# INSTRUCTIONS

Inside the bird object literal or outside as an added property, create an eat() method for the bird object. The eat() method doesn’t need any parameters.

Use eat() to check if the hungerScale property’s value is 0. If it is 0, the bird isn’t hungry and won’t eat. Log out a message stating something like “<name> is full and can’t eat more”. Substitute <name> with the property value for the bird’s name.
  
If the hungerScale isn’t 0, then the bird is still hungry! Change the value of hungerScale by subtracting 1 from the value. Subtracting 1 will decrease the value every time the method runs until the value is 0, meaning the bird doesn’t want more food. Then, log out a message in the conditional statement that says “Nom nom nom nom nom!”. Hint: Use the arithmetic operator -= for more compact code. 
  
At the bottom of the code, call bird.eat() and log out bird.isHappy().
